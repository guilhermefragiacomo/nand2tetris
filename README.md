# Nand2Tetris
## Introduction
Nand2Tetris is an free online course about developing a tetris game that can run in a computer that you made by yourself. The first part of the course is dedicated to the hardware of the computer, you start with one single logic gate (nand gate) and proceeds developing every other gate until you have built the ALU of the "Hack" computer, the memory and every other chip that is necessary to finaly build the whole "Hack" computer. The first part of the course ends by creating a assembler that can translates the "Hack" assembly language to binary code.

## Logisim
As a complement of the course, i recreated the "Hack" computer in logisim, everything besides of the memory chips were recreated almost exactly the same way as i did throughout the course.
